# KnitConverter

KnitConverter is a tool to convert image files to spreadsheets for use as colorwork knitting charts.

# Features

Given an image file, the program is able to generate both a CSV (comma-separated value) file and an Excel spreadsheet with cell colors matching the colors in the image.

The generated .xlsx file will also include row numbers on the right of the chart and column numbers below.

Naturally, as this project is open source, you are welcome to modify this behavior to suit the needs of your individual project.

# To do

- make an executable version that can be run outside of an IDE
  - ideally with a GUI
- add option for row numbers on the left
- add option to alternate row numbers between right and left
